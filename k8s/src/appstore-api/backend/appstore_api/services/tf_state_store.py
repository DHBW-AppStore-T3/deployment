"""OpenTofu state of the deployments, kept in the AppStore database (plan E3).

OpenTofu reaches it through the HTTP state backend (``routers/internal_tfstate``);
the API reads it for the resource views. The state is Fernet-encrypted at rest
because it holds every attribute of every resource, generated passwords too.

Access is per task: a queued task carries a random token in its sealed payload
and only its hash on the row. The token opens the state of that task's
deployment for as long as the task is RUNNING, so a job can neither reach
another deployment's state nor keep access after it ended.

Locking mirrors OpenTofu's HTTP backend: a lock records the lock ID, the
lock info JSON and the holding task; a lock whose task is no longer RUNNING
is stale and may be overridden, so a crashed worker cannot block a
deployment's state for good.
