"""OpenTofu's HTTP state backend (plan E3).

The worker points OpenTofu's ``http`` backend here for every job; OpenTofu
then reads, writes and locks the deployment's state itself. Credentials are
HTTP Basic: the task ID as user name and the task's state token as password
(see ``services/tf_state_store``).

Not part of the public API: left out of the OpenAPI document, and the ingress
only needs to route ``/api/appstore/`` without ``/internal`` (AP7). The token
check stands on its own either way.
