"""Regression tests for the ``ensure_*`` capability wrappers.

This module is the **regression guarantee** for two security bugs:

* Bug #1 — Privilege-Escalation: ``ensure_operate_deployment`` and
  ``ensure_view_deployment_owner`` must not let unrelated users
  pause/destroy or inspect-only foreign deployments.
* Bug #2 — Dozent-Bypass: ``ensure_edit_app`` / ``ensure_delete_app``
  / ``ensure_submit_app_version`` must reject dozents acting on
  apps they do not own.

Where the sibling :mod:`test_capabilities` module verifies the
``can_*`` booleans, this module exercises the ``ensure_*`` wrappers
end-to-end: they must raise :class:`fastapi.HTTPException` with the
documented ``status_code=403`` and a structured ``detail["code"]``
that the frontend pattern-matches on. Without these tests the bugs
could silently come back by way of a refactor flipping a boolean.

DB-less by design — ``conftest.py`` in this directory disables the
parent autouse Postgres fixture, so each test uses
:class:`unittest.mock.MagicMock` for any DB session it needs.
